    "section": "",
    "text": "Code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\n\n\nThe NFL has a problem, and it’s getting harder to ignore. Every Sunday, fans watch as star players limp off the field, backup quarterbacks take the helm, and fantasy football lineups crumble. Over the past few seasons, it feels like injuries have become more frequent and more devastating.\nBut is this just recency bias, or are injuries actually trending upward?\nLet’s look at the numbers.\nUsing injury report data from the past seven seasons (2018-2024), we can track exactly how many games players have missed due to injury during the regular season. The results paint a concerning picture for the league and suggest that the problem isn’t going away anytime soon.\n\n\nCode\ninjuries &lt;- load_injuries(\n  seasons = 2018:2024,\n  file_type = getOption(\"nflreadr.prefer\", default = \"rds\")\n) |&gt;\n  filter(game_type == \"REG\")\nout &lt;- injuries |&gt;\n  group_by(season, week, position) |&gt;\n  summarize(Out = sum(report_status == \"Out\", na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') |&gt;\n  group_by(season) |&gt;\n  arrange(week) |&gt;\n  mutate(cumulative_out = cumsum(Out))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=out, aes(x=week, y=cumulative_out)) +\n  facet_wrap(~season) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Cumulative Injuries by Season\",\n    x = \"Week\",\n    y = \"Cumulative Outs\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek by week, season by season, the numbers climb relentlessly. What’s striking isn’t just that injuries happen, it’s how consistently they accumulate throughout every season. By Week 5, teams are already dealing with dozens of missed games. By Week 10, that number has typically doubled. And by the time playoff rosters are set, most seasons have seen well over 1,000 total missed games lost to injury.\nThe pattern is remarkably consistent across all seven seasons. There’s no “fluky” year where injuries suddenly spiked or mysteriously disappeared. Instead, we see the same grinding accumulation year after year, suggesting that high injury rates are baked into the modern NFL.\nThe 2020 season, played during COVID-19 with altered off season programs, actually doesn’t look dramatically different from other years, which is surprising. Many expected the shortened training camp and lack of preseason games to lead to more injuries, but the data doesn’t bear that out.\nBut the real question is: are things getting worse over time?\n\n\nCode\nteam_injuries_full &lt;- injuries |&gt;\n  filter(game_type == \"REG\") |&gt;\n  mutate(team = case_when(\n    team == \"OAK\" ~ \"LV\",\n    team == \"SD\" ~ \"LAC\",\n    TRUE ~ team\n  )) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, team) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_outs = sum(report_status == \"Out\", na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\navg_injuries &lt;- team_injuries_full |&gt;\n  group_by(season) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_outs = mean(total_outs))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=team_injuries_full, aes(x=season, y=total_outs, group=team), \n            color=\"gray80\", alpha=0.5, size=0.8) +\n  geom_line(data=avg_injuries, aes(x=season, y=avg_outs), \n            size=1.5, color=\"darkred\") +\n  geom_point(data=avg_injuries, aes(x=season, y=avg_outs), \n             size=3, color=\"darkred\") +\n  geom_text(data=avg_injuries, aes(x=season, y=avg_outs, label=round(avg_outs, 1)), \n            vjust=-1, size=4) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Missed Games Due To Injury Per Season\",\n    subtitle = \"Individual teams in gray, league average in red\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Missed Games\"\n  ) +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is a qualified yes. Looking at the league-wide average, we can see that teams are losing more players to injury now than they were six years ago. In 2018, the average team saw 28.3 missed games due to injury. By 2024, that number had climbed to 33.6.\nThat might not sound dramatic, just over five additional games per team. But consider what it means at scale. Every team in the league is dealing with roughly five more missed games by players compared to 2018. Multiply that across 32 teams and 18 weeks, and you’re looking at hundreds of additional missed games league-wide. That’s entire rosters’ worth of players sitting out.\nThe peak came last season, further backing this claim, when teams averaged 34.1 missed games reaching nearly six more games than in 2018. While the climb has been gradual and slow, we are still seeing that increase.\nThe individual team lines (grey) tell an even more volatile story. Some franchises have seen injury counts spike dramatically in certain years, with some teams losing 50+ games to injury in a single season. Other teams have managed to stay relatively healthy, sometimes dipping below 20 missed games.\nSo, what’s the deal?\n\n\nCode\ninjury_types_out &lt;- injuries |&gt;\n  filter(game_type == \"REG\") |&gt;\n  filter(report_status == \"Out\") |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(report_primary_injury)) |&gt;\n  count(report_primary_injury) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 15)\n\nggplot(injury_types_out, aes(x=reorder(report_primary_injury, n), y=n)) +\n  geom_col(fill=\"darkred\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most Common Injuries Leading to Missed Games (2018-2024)\",\n    x = \"Injury Type\",\n    y = \"Games Missed\"\n  ) +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnee injuries dominate the injury report, accounting for more missed games than any other single injury type by a significant margin. This isn’t surprising considering knees bear enormous stress during cutting, jumping, and absorbing contact. ACL, MCL, and meniscus tears can end seasons in an instant.\nAnkles come in second, a joint that takes punishment on every play. Ankle sprains range from minor nuisances to severe high-ankle injuries that can sideline players for weeks to months.\nHamstrings come in third, reflecting the explosive speed and acceleration modern NFL players generate. These injuries often linger and recur, keeping players sidelined for weeks even when they’re not season-ending.\nConcussions, while lower on the list by raw numbers, represent one of the most serious concerns for player safety. The league has made concussion protocol a priority, but head injuries remain an unavoidable reality in a collision sport.\nFoot, shoulder, hip, and calf injuries round out the top causes. These aren’t freak accidents, but they’re the result of the physical toll the game takes on players’ bodies week after week. The human body simply wasn’t designed to absorb the forces generated when 300-pound linemen collide at full speed, or when defensive backs try to tackle running backs moving at 20 mph.\nNotably, many of these injuries like hamstrings, calves, backs—are soft tissue injuries that can sometimes be linked to training, conditioning, and workload management. This suggests there may be room for teams to improve their injury prevention programs, though the data shows that even the best-run organizations can’t escape injury problems entirely.\nThese injuries are resulting from how fast the NFL has gotten.\n\n\nCode\npos &lt;- injuries |&gt;\n  group_by(position) |&gt;\n  summarize(Out = sum(report_status == \"Out\", na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = pos, aes(x = reorder(position, Out), weight = Out))+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Amount of Games Missed Per Position (2018-2024)\",\n    x = \"Position\",\n    y = \"Games Missed\"\n  ) +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCornerback, wide receiver, and linebacker are the top three most injured positions by a long shot. It’s no coincidence that the fastest playing players and the ones who tend to take the blunt of each and every hit are the ones falling to these lower body and head injuries.\nWhile the NFL has created rules and invented new technologies to prevent injuries and keep players in the game, it seems they are being out paced by how sped up the league is getting.\nThe numbers don’t lie, NFL injuries are trending upward, and the league’s countermeasures aren’t working. As the game gets faster and more physical, players’ bodies are paying the price. Rule changes and medical advances have helped, but they can’t overcome basic physics. When elite athletes weighing 250 pounds collide at full speed, something has to give. Until the NFL makes more dramatic changes, things like shorter seasons (which will never happen), mandatory rest periods (like an extra bye week), or fundamental alterations to how the game is played, injuries will continue to climb. For now, fans should get used to seeing their favorite players in street clothes on Sunday. Because in the modern NFL, the question isn’t if a star will get injured, but when."

Through twelve weeks, this season is tracking to be the worst injury year on record. Players and fans are rightfully demanding answers.\nThe easy answer? Blame the turf. Artificial surfaces have been a popular scapegoat for years, with high profile players calling for grass mandates across the league. But when you actually dig into the data, turf isn’t driving the 2025 injury surge. Something else is broken.\nLet’s start with how bad it really is. Through 12 weeks, the 2025 season has seen significantly more injuries than any comparable point in NFL history.\n\n\nCode\navg_by_week &lt;- injuries_historical |&gt;\n  filter(season &gt;= 2020, report_status == \"Out\") |&gt;\n  count(week) |&gt;\n  mutate(avg_historical = n / 5) |&gt;\n  select(week, avg_historical)\n\ncomparison_bars &lt;- injuries_2025 |&gt;\n  select(week, injuries_2025 = injury_count) |&gt;\n  left_join(avg_by_week, by = \"week\") |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(injuries_2025, avg_historical), \n               names_to = \"period\", values_to = \"injuries\")\n\nggplot(comparison_bars, aes(x = week, y = injuries, fill = period)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"avg_historical\" = \"gray50\", \"injuries_2025\" = \"red3\"),\n                    labels = c(\"2020-2024 Avg\", \"2025\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"2025 Exceeds Historical Average Nearly Every Week\",\n    x = \"Week\", y = \"Injuries\",\n    fill = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek after week, the red bars tower over the gray. This isn’t a one week spike or a statistical fluke. 2025 is consistently, measurably worse than the five year average. Almost every single week has exceeded historical norms.\n\n\nCode\nrecent_comparison &lt;- injuries_historical |&gt;\n  filter(season &gt;= 2020, report_status == \"Out\") |&gt;\n  group_by(season, week) |&gt;\n  summarize(weekly_outs = n(), .groups = 'drop') |&gt;\n  bind_rows(\n    injuries_2025 |&gt; \n      select(season, week, weekly_outs = injury_count)\n  )\n\nggplot(recent_comparison, aes(x = week, y = weekly_outs, group = season, color = factor(season))) +\n  geom_line(data = recent_comparison |&gt; filter(season &lt; 2025), size = 1, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(data = recent_comparison |&gt; filter(season == 2025), size = 2, color = \"red\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(rep(\"gray60\", 5), \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"2025 Has More Injuries Almost Every Single Week\",\n    x = \"Week\", y = \"Weekly Injuries\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you plot 2025 against recent seasons, the story becomes even clearer. That red line sits above the pack almost constantly. The league isn’t just having a bad month but it’s having a catastrophically bad season from start to finish.\n\n\nCode\nstep_data &lt;- injuries_historical |&gt;\n  filter(season &gt;= 2022, report_status == \"Out\") |&gt;\n  group_by(season, week) |&gt;\n  summarize(Out = n(), .groups = 'drop') |&gt;\n  group_by(season) |&gt;\n  arrange(week) |&gt;\n  mutate(cumulative = cumsum(Out)) |&gt;\n  bind_rows(\n    injuries_2025_cumulative |&gt; select(season, week, cumulative = cumulative_out)\n  )\n\nggplot(step_data, aes(x = week, y = cumulative, color = factor(season))) +\n  geom_step(size = 1.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"2022\" = \"gray70\", \"2023\" = \"gray50\", \n                                 \"2024\" = \"gray30\", \"2025\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"2025 Separating from the Pack\",\n    x = \"Week\", y = \"Cumulative Injuries\",\n    color = \"Season\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Week 12, 2025 has pulled significantly ahead of 2022, 2023, and 2024 in cumulative injuries. The gap isn’t closing but it’s widening. If this pace continues through the remaining weeks, 2025 will shatter previous records.\nBased on current trends, the season is projected to finish with over 1,300 total missed games due to injury. That would represent a substantial increase over 2024 and mark the highest count in the modern injury reporting era.\nFor years, the narrative has been simple: artificial turf causes more injuries than natural grass, particularly lower body injuries like knees, ankles, and hamstrings. Players hate it. The Players Association wants it banned. It seems like an obvious culprit for rising injury rates.\nBut the data doesn’t support turf as the driver of the 2025 surge.\n\n\nCode\nschedules &lt;- load_schedules(seasons = 2009:2024) |&gt;\n  filter(game_type == \"REG\")\n\ngame_surfaces &lt;- schedules |&gt;\n  select(season, week, home_team, away_team, surface) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(surface)) |&gt;\n  mutate(surface_type = if_else(str_detect(tolower(surface), \"grass\"), \n                                 \"Grass\", \"Turf\"))\n\ninjuries_with_team &lt;- injuries_historical |&gt;\n  filter(report_status == \"Out\", !is.na(team))\n\ninjuries_home &lt;- injuries_with_team |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    game_surfaces |&gt; select(season, week, team = home_team, surface_type),\n    by = c(\"season\", \"week\", \"team\")\n  )\n\ninjuries_away &lt;- injuries_with_team |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    game_surfaces |&gt; select(season, week, team = away_team, surface_type),\n    by = c(\"season\", \"week\", \"team\")\n  )\n\ninjuries_with_surface &lt;- bind_rows(injuries_home, injuries_away) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(surface_type)) |&gt;\n  distinct()\n\ngames_by_surface &lt;- game_surfaces |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(home_team, away_team), values_to = \"team\") |&gt;\n  count(surface_type, name = \"games\")\n\ninjury_totals &lt;- injuries_with_surface |&gt;\n  count(surface_type, name = \"injuries\")\n\ncomparison_data &lt;- games_by_surface |&gt;\n  left_join(injury_totals, by = \"surface_type\") |&gt;\n  mutate(injuries_per_game = injuries / games) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(games, injuries, injuries_per_game),\n               names_to = \"metric\", values_to = \"value\")\n\nggplot(comparison_data, aes(x = surface_type, y = value, fill = surface_type)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(~ metric, scales = \"free_y\", \n             labeller = labeller(metric = c(\n               games = \"Total Games\",\n               injuries = \"Total Injuries\", \n               injuries_per_game = \"Injuries Per Game\"\n             ))) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Grass\" = \"green4\", \"Turf\" = \"red3\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"2009-2024 Similar Injury Rates Despite Different Totals\",\n    subtitle = \"More games were played on grass, yet the averages are nearly identical\",\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you look at total injuries by type, grass accounts for more than turf in nearly every category. Knee injuries? More on grass. Ankle injuries? More on grass. Hamstrings? Grass again.\nBut that’s misleading. More games are played on grass which is about 56% versus 44% turf. When you calculate injuries per game played, the rates are virtually identical. Turf isn’t meaningfully more dangerous.\nMore importantly, the turf to grass ratio has barely changed over the past five years. If turf were driving the 2025 spike, we’d need to see massive new turf installations. We don’t. The 56/44 split has held steady while injuries climbed 15 to 20%.\n\n\nCode\ninjury_rates &lt;- injuries_with_surface |&gt;\n  count(season, surface_type) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    game_surfaces |&gt;\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(home_team, away_team), values_to = \"team\") |&gt;\n      count(season, surface_type, name = \"games\"),\n    by = c(\"season\", \"surface_type\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(injuries_per_game = n / games)\n\nggplot(injury_rates, aes(x = season, y = injuries_per_game, \n                         color = surface_type, group = surface_type)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Grass\" = \"green4\", \"Turf\" = \"red3\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Injury Rates Similar Across Both Surfaces Over Time\",\n    subtitle = \"Neither surface explains the upward trend\",\n    x = \"Season\", y = \"Injuries Per Game\",\n    color = \"Surface\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf turf were causing the 2025 spike, we’d see this red line pulling dramatically away from the green. We don’t. Both surfaces show the same troubling upward trend.\n\n\nCode\ninjury_by_type_surface &lt;- injuries_with_surface |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(report_primary_injury)) |&gt;\n  count(surface_type, report_primary_injury)\n\ntop_injuries &lt;- injury_by_type_surface |&gt;\n  group_by(report_primary_injury) |&gt;\n  summarize(total = sum(n)) |&gt;\n  slice_max(total, n = 8) |&gt;\n  pull(report_primary_injury)\n\ninjury_surface_bars &lt;- injury_by_type_surface |&gt;\n  filter(report_primary_injury %in% top_injuries)\n\nggplot(injury_surface_bars, aes(x = reorder(report_primary_injury, n), \n                                 y = n, fill = surface_type)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Grass\" = \"green4\", \"Turf\" = \"red3\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Grass Shows More Total Injuries (Because More Games)\",\n    subtitle = \"When adjusted for game count, rates are similar\",\n    x = NULL, y = \"Total Injuries\",\n    fill = \"Surface\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven for injury specific analysis, grass shows higher raw totals simply due to more games played. The pattern is consistent: turf isn’t the villain here.\nThursday Night Football forces teams to play on three days rest. Bodies can’t recover that fast. Soft tissue injuries like hamstrings, calves, and groins are textbook signs of inadequate recovery. The 2025 schedule packed in more short week games than ever, especially early in the season when the injury spike began.\nThe NFL is faster than ever. Linebackers run 20+ mph making violent cuts. Physics is unforgiving: kinetic energy increases with the square of velocity. Faster players mean exponentially larger collision forces. Human ligaments weren’t designed for this.\nAfter criticism about “soft” practices, teams ramped up 2025 training camps. More contact, longer sessions, harder conditioning. Multiple teams reported unusual soft tissue injuries in August and September. Players entered the season already compromised.\nUnseasonably hot temperatures hit multiple NFL markets in September and October. Heat exhaustion and cramping increase injury risk. Several high profile injuries happened in late game situations when fatigue compounded the heat.\nModern NFL football has outpaced human biology. Players are bigger, faster, stronger. But ACLs can only handle so much torque. Hamstrings can only fire so many times. When forces exceed what tissue can withstand, injuries are inevitable.\nThe league made superficial changes like helmet rules, concussion protocols, and targeting penalties. These help on the margins. But they don’t address the core problem: the game is too fast, too violent, and too compressed for bodies to survive intact.\nBanning turf would be popular with players. It might reduce injuries slightly. But it won’t solve the 2025 crisis or prevent the 2026 crisis.\nReal solutions require painful choices: longer seasons with more bye weeks, eliminating Thursday games, and mandatory rest periods. These cost money and disrupt TV schedules. So the league keeps tweaking around the edges while injuries climb.\nSix weeks remain in the regular season. The injury count will only grow. We’re heading toward the worst season in modern NFL history.\nPlayers will keep calling for turf bans, and that’s understandable. But even if every stadium switched to grass tomorrow, it wouldn’t stop the bleeding.\nThe problem isn’t what players run on. It’s how fast they’re running, how often, and how little recovery time they get. Until the NFL addresses those structural issues, injuries will keep climbing regardless of surface.\nFor now, get used to backup quarterbacks, practice squad callups, and injury depleted rosters. In 2025, that’s not the exception but it’s reality."
